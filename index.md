Hello and welcome to RandomVariable!

I am S T Nielsen and am an engineer with a master's degree in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. My master thesis project was about exploring microbial diversity in metagenomics, which mainly involved applying bioinformatics tools, information theory, statistical data analysis, and data visualisation. Prior to this, I did a bachelor's program in Biotechnology and my bachelor thesis project was about extraction, growth, and purified re-culturing of soil-borne bacteria and fungi, followed by estimation of the specific activity of amylases extracted from those microbial cultures.

My research interests include microbiomes, ancient and environmental DNA, ecological modelling with ecoinformatics, and population genetics.

Here, you can find a few of my learnings and write-ups about my areas of interest in data science, genomics, bioinformatics and ecoinformatics.
